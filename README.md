# ecg_classification_DL

Master's thesis

This repository puts multiple ECG datasets for arrhythmia detection and arrhythmia detection methods under one umbrella. The focus is on using only one ECG lead in all methods. Initially, two different arrhythmia tasks are considered: rhythm classification and heartbeat classification (morphological arrhythmia detection). The tasks are defined in the /tasks folder.
